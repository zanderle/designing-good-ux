# Designing Good User Experience

A collection of resources used at my DjangoCon tutorial called [Designing Good User Experience](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/56/).  
[Slides are also available](https://speakerdeck.com/zanderle/designing-good-user-experience).

## NOTE:

Initially I didn't think I'll also add details of the hands-on stuff we did at the tutorial. So that's still a work in progress and I need to write up some more, to make things clearer. I will add that in the following days.
