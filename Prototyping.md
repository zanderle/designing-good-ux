* Paper prototypes

## Your task

* Create a paper prototype for your app. It should be about the same size as an actual thing
* Cut out different parts (dropdown menus, modals, etc.) to use them interactively
* If it’s too much content, create only a few screens
* Prototype should be able to “respond” to some of the user’s interactions
* In the end, test it with someone
