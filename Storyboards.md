# Storyboards

* Decide what you're going to work on
* A sketch or an overview of what your app/product wishes to accomplish
* Presents a problem and a possible solution (but nothing specific!)
* It should be simple & fast

## Your task

* Create 2 storyboards (each with 4-8 frames)
* They should present a different point of view (different solutions)
* They should clearly show a setting, present the problem and end with the solution to the problem
* Don’t include any actual implementation details (we’ll do that later)
